# Autobuild

Autobuild allows your character to automatically build nearby entity blueprint ghosts when standing still, and to deconstruct nearby entities.  Toolbar and keyboard shortcuts to enable or disable automatic construction and deconstruction.  Autobuild uses a very efficient method to track ghosts and entities marked for deconstruction, minimizing UPS costs even when using other mods that grant a huge build radius.

Added shortcut (Middle mouse button) to instantly build all.
